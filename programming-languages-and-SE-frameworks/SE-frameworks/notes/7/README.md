# Pair programming

Pair programming is the act of having two programmers work on the same
task. One person will be designated as the driver and the other will be
the navigator. The two roles switch frequently.

## Advantages

* Pair programming can help catch bugs the driver has missed.
  * Working together will ensure that best practice is being followed
* Shared knowledge can be spread if two developers are working together.
  * Good way to train up new developers by pairing with a more
    experienced developer.
  * Allows for an additional developer to familiar with the developing
    code
* Reduces procrastination if there is motivation from another.
* works well with TDD.


## Disadvantages

* Increase cost of developers to develop on the application.
* Not all personalities match and rifts may happen.
* Not all developers like to be watched over and prefer to work alone.
