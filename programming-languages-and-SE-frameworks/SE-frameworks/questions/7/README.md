# Scrumban

## Describe scrumban

Scrumban takes the management overhead of scrum and combines it with the
visualization of kanban.

## Why would a team choose scrumban over scrum or kanban?

Scrumbans hybrid approach allows for existing management structures to
introduce elements of kanban to scrum teams.

## When should a team use Scrumban?

* For maintenance of ongoing projects
  * There is no definitive end date for the work due to the added
    flexibility of Scrumban
* A team that find it difficult to sue Scrum
  * A company mat not have enough resources or specialised roles for
    Scrum or working with scrum may be too rigid.
* Srum only sets specific tasks to members for each sprint but Scrumban
  sets a broad list of projects and allows the team to determine how
  best to leverage its resources. this allows team members to find the
  projects that are best for themselves.

## What are the Scrum features in Scrumban?

* Process iteration happens at consistent intervals, typically at the end of sprints when the team holds sprint retrospectives and sprint review meetings. 

* Work is prioritized based on the complexity of the task and product demand.

* The entire team agrees and aligns on what “done” means, so everyone knows what it means to complete a task. This means that end results are clearly outlined and defined.

## What are the Kanban features in Scrumban?

* Uses a clear backlog of items that need to be completed. Once a team member starts working on a task, they "pull" those tasks from the backlog into their current workload.

* There are hard set limits for the amount of tasks that are currently in progress to prevent the team from being overworked.

* Tasks are visually represented as cards that move through different stages of the process on a Kanban board.

## Features unique to Scrumban only?

* There’s no team hierarchy in Scrumban. This means that every person on the development team has the same opportunity as others to make decisions and choices. This also means that there is no clear leader for the group—rather, the team is entirely self-managed.

* Scrumban projects don’t necessarily need to have a deadline. Sprints are often worked in two-week increments, so team members can just focus on those specific sprint tasks until it’s time to review and reiterate. This makes Scrumban a good choice for very long-term projects, or projects with an ambiguous goal.
