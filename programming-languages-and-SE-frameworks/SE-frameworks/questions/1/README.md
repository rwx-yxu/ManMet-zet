# Software life cycle - Q:Spiral

## What are the key features of the spiral model?
* Emphasis risk handling by evaluating risks at each phase.
* Allows for the product to evolve overtime as each spiral is completed
  because more risks are managed throughout.

## What are the phases that make up a spiral model?
* Object determination and identify alternative solutions.
* Resolve risks and select best possible solution.
* Develop next version of product.
* Review current version and plan next phase.

## Why would a company use a spiral model?
* For projects that have ambiguous specification.
* Projects that involve large risk as defined as any adverse situation.
  that might effect the successful completion of the project.
* Allows for the project to evolve overtime ask more risks are handled
  minimising cost.

## Describe situations where the spiral model is not suitable
* Not suited for projects that have a clear specification defined at the
  start.
* Clients that do not intend to make changes over the course of the
  project after gathering requirements.
* Highly complex by requiring more investment from the client and
  management to identify risks. This make it more difficult to set time
  scales because phases may not be known at the start of the project.

## Provide a difference between the waterfall model and spiral
* The waterfall model executes each sequentially where as the spiral
  model evolves overtime.
* Risk is at the center of spiral where as requirements and
  specifications are defined at the in a waterfall model.

## Provide a common issue between a waterfall model and spiral
* Both models do not have depth during each stage of their life cycles
  such that feedback cannot be actioned upon during the process of the
  stage.
* More difficult for management to set deliverable time scales because
  stages are ambiguous in time scale.
