# Software life cycle
There are two types of software companies:
* Software service - provides bespoke software tailored to customer
  requirements.
* Software product - creates internal products to sell off to customers.
  For example, Netflix or Microsoft.

Development for software product companies are continuous and carry on
beyond development.

Software service companies on the other hand maintains a service
contract once development is finished.

The development process between these two types of companies are largely
the same. Requirements gathering for service companies may be slower
because communication needs to be maintained throughout to ensure that
the product provided meets specification.

Product companies are more likely to deliver continuous updates whereas
service companies will deliver a complete product to customers.

We need a specific process to follow for software development to be able
to deliver the best product to customers

## Waterfall
This life cycle is has stages that follow one after the other.
The stages involved in this life cycle include:
* Requirement and analysis
* Design
* Development
* Testing
* Deployment
* Maintenance
The waterfall model is suited for teams that has experience making
similar software. As well as for software that requires safety or
security checks as paramount requirements such as banking. The types of
companies that will use this model tend to have large bureaucracy.

This model is discouraged because requirements can change during
development whereby new discoveries are made. It can be costly to back
to the start and redesign. The lack of flexibility with this model
allows for a higher risk of being late or expensive.

### Iterative models
An iterative model of waterfall allows for iteration to build upon
development. An iteration is defined as Requirements -> deployment
repeated until completion. The first set of iterations focus on the
basic / core version. Each iteration allows for problems to be spotted
early with regular feedback from stake holders.

The disadvantage for this approach would be that progress for each
iteration is more complex for management to understand because
stages are being repeated each iteration. The constant change will also
compromise design if not managed with a clear vision.

## Spiral
The spiral model emphasises risk handling.
The spiral model is defined by:
* Object determination and identify alternative solutions - Requirements
  are gathered from customers to define objectives at the start of every
  phase. Alternative solutions are also provided during this phase.
* Identify and resolve risks - All solutions are evaluated to select the
  best possible solution. Risks are associated with the identified
  solution and a strategy is developed to best resolve the risk. At the
  end, a prototype is built for solution.
* Develop next version of product - Development and testing stage. A new
  version of the software is created at the end.
* Review and plan for next phase - Customers evaluate the current
  developed version. Planning for next phase starts.
* Repeat
The number of phases can vary between projects which are typically
determined by the project manager.
A loop is one cycle of product development.
A risk is defined as any adverse situation that might affect the
successful completion of the software project.
The spiral model is designed to handling unknown risks after a project
has started. This is done by providing a prototype build at every phase.

### Advantages
* Risk handling - Most suitable for projects with an undefined scope
  that has many unknown risks due to risk analysis and handling at every
  phase.
