#Waterfall

## What are the key features of the waterfall model?
* The waterfall model is a software system life cycle that requires each
stage to be sequential.
* Planning and design stages are typically long to ensure that
  everything is covered

## What teams are suited for this model?
Suited for experienced teams that specialise in a subject area such as a
service company.

## What types of companies that would the waterfall model work for?
Typically, services companies that require strict compliance. An example
of this would be government contracts that require critical systems to
accurately meet specification defined.

## Why would this model be chosen over spiral?
This model may be more suited for when the specification are clearly
defined early on in the life cycle. It is also more suited for clients
that are unlikely to change requirements once started.

## Why might this model be discouraged?
Often times, requirements change overtime as more discoveries are made.
This can be costly for the waterfall model in particular because of the
requirement to go back to the start. Deadline creep can also happen
because delays will have a knock on effect.

## How can waterfall be improved?
An alteration that can be made would be to introduce an iterative cycle
from requirements -> deployment. This would allow for incremental
improvements to be made as requirements change. However, each iteration
is more complex for management to understand for deliverables.

## How might the waterfall model be beneficial?
* Developer on boarding can be easier because all of requirements are laid out
  in the specification.
* Easy to measure progress according to clearly defined milestones.
