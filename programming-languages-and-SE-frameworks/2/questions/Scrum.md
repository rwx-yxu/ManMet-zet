## Describe a sprint?
A sprint is a fixed time window that contains:
* Sprints are consistent through out the software life cycle.
* A new sprint is started after one ends.
* An increment is usually delivered at the end of a sprint.
* A Review process is taken place at the end of a sprint.

## Disadvantages of scrum
* Requires participants to be highly motivated to meet sprint deadlines.
* Reliant on key members for management which means that if a key member
  leaves during a life cycle, it may be difficult for a new member to
  replace.
* Requires in person meetings for effective communication. Remote
  working internationally may be difficult to involve everyone.

## Advantages of scrum
* Large projects can be split into manageable sprints.
* Visibility of each participants work due to daily stand ups.
* Sprints enable feedback more readily.
