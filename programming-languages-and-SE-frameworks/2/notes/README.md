# Agile
* Agile is **not** a methodology.
* Agile is more of a philosophy that can be implemented in different
  ways.
* At its core, agile emphasises continuous delivery:
  * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
  * Working software over comprehensive documentation.
  * Customer collaboration over contract negotiations.
  * Responding to change over following the plan.
* There is less emphasis on documentation because increments are small
  which leads to the design work to be done informally as part of
  implementation.
* Key aspect is being able to adapt as the project progresses.

## Kanban
* Originally designed for manufacturing by Toyota.
* Modeled as a pipeline segmented by process.
* Tasks are listed with a maximum for each process to manage output.
* There is no set team structure because participants are encouraged to
  work autonomously.
* Good for teams that are experienced that can progress each feature
  through the pipeline that do not require management overhead.
* Requires discipline to maintain because there are no roles or
  responsibilities.
* This can also lack clear time frame estimates because there are no
  strict time scales set for deployment.
* Task cards present a single unit of work.
  * Tasks are moved through the kanban board.
  * Tasks should be short, precise and measurable to ensure incremental
    delivery when deployed.
  * Large tasks are discouraged and should be broken down into smaller
    tasks.
  * Control how many tasks are being actioned at each stage that is suited to
    the teams capacity of output.
* Allows for creative solutions to flourish because there is less
  management overhead.
* Suitable for continuous integration. Constantly evolving projects
  because there is no review at the end of a sprint. Long term evolving
  projects suits kanban since there is no structure compared to scrum.
* Good for remote collaboration.


## Scrum
* Is software development and project management methodology that
  focuses on rapid delivery of partial solutions in a fixed time window.
* Unlike Kanban, work is divided into fixed time periods (often 2 weeks)
  called sprints.
* Plan is reassessed at the end of every sprint.
* Code is usually released at the end of every sprint.
* There are three main scrum member types:
  * Product owner - Stake holder of the system. Determines the direction of
    the product. Prioritise the system requirements.
  * Scrum master - In charge of the scrum team. Help make decisions when
    roadblocks are encountered.
  * Development - Developers that implement the sprint.
* Suitable for set management structure
* Contract obligations
* Requires to be in the office.

# Scrumban
* Less management overhead.
* More empowerment to the team.
* Management of scrum but added with the visualization of kanban.
* No sprint planning. Reducing management overhead.
* The scrum ban board allows managers to visualize potential project
  bottle necks.
