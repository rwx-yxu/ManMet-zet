#Peer to Peer

## Describe a peer to peer connection
Each node are the same forming a network. There is are no chain of
responsibility.

## Advantages of peer to peer
Allows for the network to be redundant. A node going down does not
affect the rest of the network.
No one centralise point will stop the system from working.
Reduced cost - no need to invest in infrastructure to keep network
operating so long as there are nodes connected.

## Disadvantages of peer to peer
Typically slower because communication requires an additional step to
identify nodes when sending data.
Large networks need to calculate the best optimal path to a node in a
peer to peer system.
Bottle necks can happen if one node is slower than other nodes.

## Projects that suit peer to peer. Why?
Highly critical systems that require high reliability such as space
flight.

## Peer to peer is too complex. Agree / disagree?


## Should master-slave be chosen over peer to peer?
